I've been taking online courses for a while. Dabbled in several languages via many different online platforms. Did I really learn to code that way....nope, not really. But it did give me an idea about what coding is, and what it takes to be a Software Engineer. 

The biggest step is a dedicated decision. Not a halfhearted Decision. Not a doubting Decision. But a clear, focused understanding of what the hell you are doing this for...I don't care if it's for money, prestige, a new car, a startup, whatever...know why the hell you are doing this, what do you want to get out of it, and follow that decision all the way through! 

My Biggest Mistake...NOT FINISHING!!!!!


Finish!!  Finish!!!  Finish!!!

We could all learn this for free honestly. But learn.co gives you a sense of community, direction and completion of each task. You have someone there to help you through your mistakes and lack of understanding, and I didn't know the value of that until I DECIDED to find out.

So, see it through. Even if you don't know what the hell you are doing sometimes. Even if you don't know if you are learning anything (which I highly doubt). Keep going. 

I'm fighting my way through.....So can you!
